# Living-Story-Book
This is an application similar to "Story Bird," but geared toward more novice users. The application allows for users to create picture books with ease and then publish and share them.  If a user is registered, he or she may use his or her own clipart rather than the generic library that is provided for all users.  A registered user may also save and update existing books before and after publishing them.  When browsing the library of published books, users may have pages read to them via HTML5s text to speech functionality.

# Getting Started
1) Fork and clone the repository.  
2) npm Install  
3) Bower Install  
4) Run node seed (note: you might have to manually create a database named "story-book")  
5) npm start  
6) run localhost:1337 in the browser and that's it!
